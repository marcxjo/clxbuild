clxbuild: arch-like wrapper script for easy packaging on cucumber linux

This is a utility to build packages for Cucumber Linux and derivatives
through the use of makepkg.

Please note root access is required. Use of fakeroot for running
clxbuild is advised. Read the man pages clxbuild(8) and CLXBUILD(5)

 BE CAREFUL when adjusting build files as they could potentially harm your
 system if not done properly, especially when running as root!
