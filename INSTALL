clxbuild: arch-like wrapper script for easy packaging on Cucumber Linux

This distribution will run on most UNIX systems.
Its currently developed under Linux.

Installing
---------

The preferred method for installing clxbuild is to use the Makefile script
compatible with most UNIX systems that contain the "make" command.

To install clxbuild on these platforms run the following commands:

    make
    make install

There are several optional parameters that you may pass to the Makefile
script to customize clxbuild for your applications. These include:

* DESTDIR: The default destination directory (default: /)
* PREFIX: The default prefix (default: /usr/local)
* SYSCONFDIR: The default configuration location (default: /etc)

You can export these as environment variables or put them in the same
line as the make commands. If SYSCONFDIR is to be set, it should be done
both for both steps. Example:

    make
    make install PREFIX=/usr
